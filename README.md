### Directory descriptions

- `data/raw/`: raw datasets, such as satellite imagery or weather observations.
- `data/processed/`: cleaned and transformed datasets ready for analysis.
- `code/`: R, python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- `docs/`: reports, presentations, and other documentation materials.

## Example workflow

### 1. Load raw data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load raw dataset
raw_data = pd.read_csv('data/raw/climate_data.csv')
print(raw_data.info())
```

### 2. Process and save data

```python
# Clean data
processed_data = raw_data.dropna(subset=['temperature', 'precipitation'])

# Save to processed folder
processed_data.to_csv('data/processed/cleaned_climate_data.csv', index=False)
print("Processed data saved.")
```

### 3. Analyze data

```python
# Perform analysis
mean_temp = processed_data['temperature'].mean()
print(f"Average temperature: {mean_temp:.2f}")
```

### 4. Document results

Summarize findings and save visualizations or reports in the `docs/` directory.
